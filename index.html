            <p>
                I have been working in kitchens since I was 17 years old, but computers, IT and technology in general was always my passion. Recently I've decided to finaly start persueing my dream to become a developerto close my last gestalt in this life. This is my first practice web page, it is very simple since i am just practicing.
